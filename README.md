## Description 

Budget Tracker is a full-stack application that allows the user to add and complete workouts or exercises. 
Additionally, the user can check their workout dashboard to visualize graphics of their workout progress and data. 

This project enabled me to gain a better understadning of looking at pre-existing code and alalyzing where the connections
need to be made in order for it to become a fully functioning application. I also gained a better understanding of MongoDB and mongoose.
